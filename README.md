# Isomorphic
This is a minecraft datapack library, which aims to persist 1 to 1 behaviours with the base game, whilst reducing the `minecraft` item namespace to permit usage of those names by datapack developers.

## List of freed names
As of v1.0, there are 9 item names available for use:
- `minecraft:music_disc_blocks`
- `minecraft:music_disc_chirp`
- `minecraft:music_disc_far`
- `minecraft:music_disc_mall`
- `minecraft:music_disc_stal`
- `minecraft:music_disc_strad`
