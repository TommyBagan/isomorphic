# Isomorphic
## Description
This is a minecraft datapack library, which aims to persist 1 to 1 behaviours with the base game, whilst reducing the `minecraft` item namespace to permit usage of those names by datapack developers.

## Reasoning

## FAQ
### "I need more custom items! Please add more!"
This datapack is maximalist, meaning we attempt to free up as much of the namespace as possible, within the bounds of maintaining vanilla behaviours. However, I do post suggestions for Mojang to enable more items:
